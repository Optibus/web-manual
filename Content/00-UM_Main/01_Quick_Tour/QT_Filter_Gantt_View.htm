        <h2>Filtering the Gantt Views</h2>
        <p class="BodyText">The two Gantts show an immense amount of information. You can use the Filter button to limit the view. Suppose for example, that we want to see blocks for sign 150. On the Vehicles Gantt, open the Filter:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/sc_00970.png" class="PageMaxWidth" style="width: 388px;height: 183px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">In the Trips <span class="bold">Sign </span>field, click over the <span class="bold">Search for Signs </span>area. You are offered a list of available signs:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/sc_00980.png" style="width: 388px;height: 172px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">You may choose as many as you like (use the scroll bar to see more). We will choose sign 150 and click <span class="bold">Apply</span>. Here is the result:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/sc_00990.png" class="PageMaxWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The filter extracted all blocks including sign 150.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The choice of filters for the Drivers Gantt is much more extensive, and we won't show the details here. However, if you again filter on sign 150, here is the result:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/sc_01000.png" class="PageMaxWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The filter extracted all drivers (duties) including sign 150 during the working day.</p>
