        <h2>Scope of this Chapter</h2>
        <p class="BodyText">Schedule optimization is always with respect to the schedule preferences - even if they are default preferences as might be the case in first optimization.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">In this chapter therefore, we commences with technical background information about Optimization.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">We then proceed with a detailed discussion about the Preferences. The Preferences are for most part, elaborate forms (or templates) required to configure a complete topic.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Having saved your preferences, you  then optimize the schedule to see their effect both visually on the Gantts and on the KPIs.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The preferences that you set are cumulative. There is however, a method for "throwing away" unwanted preferences for a specific topic.</p>
