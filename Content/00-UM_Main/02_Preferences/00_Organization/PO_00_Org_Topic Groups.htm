        <h3><a name="Topic"></a>Topic Section Grouping</h3>
        <p class="BodyText">The Preferences are organized into four topic groups, Vehicles, Drivers, Depots and Miscellaneous. The fourth group is a "catchall" to cover items that do not fit into the first three groups. Look at the preferences opening window, each of the five topics shown is a toggle. For example, click <span class="bold">Vehicles</span>:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/sc_01450.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">These are the Vehicle topics in use for the current open schedule. This presentation is ideal for schedule maintenance based on modifying pre-installed or your own existing preferences. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To see all of the available Vehicle topics, click the <span class="bold">All </span>button:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/sc_01460.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Topics in use are checked. The topic list runs of the screen and you will need the scroll bar to see them all.  </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Clicking the <span class="bold">Vehicles</span> restores the window to the state of <MadCap:xref href="#Preferen" class="figure_caption">Figure 1-1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The foregoing pattern applies to the other three groups.</p>
