Using the Assign Vehicles Button

To complete the session you must click the  Assign Vehicles button. An advanced usage is available by opening button's context menu:
Regeneration duty IDsed

If you have moved trips or added new elements you will have to regenerate some or all of the duty IDs. You can choose between the following:

    Modified – regenerated only the ids of the duties that have been manually modified
    New – regenerate ids only for new duties that the user manually added
    No – the duty ids will stay the same, no regeneration
    Mismatch – Change the minimum number of ids possible as long as they are aligned with the id generation rules (only the id’s that are not aligned are being changed)
    All – regenerate all of the duty id’s 

Mode:

    Quick: The system takes only the duties that have been “touched” and that their vehicles are in the stack and assigns them with the rest of the duties to vehicles.
    Full: The system takes all of the duties and assigns them to vehicles – with a preference of connecting duties - that are placed one below the other- under the same vehicle (this is how the manual option to move the duties and reorder them can affect the vehicles assignment).
